Node to read a file encoding desired dual-\/arm joint-\/space motions, convert to a trajectory, and send as a goal request to the trajectory streamer action server. Playfile\-\_\-reader\-\_\-jointspace takes in a list of successive joint angles (\char`\"{}records\char`\"{}) as a Joint Space File. Additional information on the Joint Space File format can be found in \href{Joint_Grimoire.pdf}{\tt Joint\-\_\-\-Grimoire.\-pdf}, section Joint Space File Format; example .jsp files are in playfile\-\_\-reader/play/jsp

Playfile\-\_\-reader\-\_\-cartspace and playfile\-\_\-reader\-\_\-cameraspace both take in the positions and rotations of the Da\-Vinci grippers, using inverse kinematics to produce and execute a full trajectory. Playfile\-\_\-reader\-\_\-cartspace will read coordinates in the frame of Da Vinci's cameras-\/ specifically, left\-\_\-camera\-\_\-optical\-\_\-frame. Playfile\-\_\-reader\-\_\-cartspace uses the P\-S\-M coordinate spaces for the respective arms-\/ one\-\_\-psm\-\_\-base\-\_\-link and two\-\_\-psm\-\_\-base\-\_\-link. \mbox{[}\mbox{[}W\-I\-P\mbox{]}\mbox{]}

The file is read, checked for size consistency (though not for joint-\/range viability, nor speed viability) The file is packed up as a \char`\"{}trajectory\char`\"{} message and delivered within a \char`\"{}goal\char`\"{} message to the trajectory-\/streamer action server.

All three readers can either read playfiles directly from a file path {\ttfamily roslaunch playfile\-\_\-reader playfile\-\_\-jointspace $\sim$/ros\-\_\-ws/absolute/path/to/jointfile.jsp}

{\ttfamily cd $\sim$/ros\-\_\-ws roslaunch playfile\-\_\-reader playfile\-\_\-jointspace relative/path/to/jointfile.\-jsp}

or from a R\-O\-S package

{\ttfamily roslaunch playfile\-\_\-reader playfile\-\_\-jointspace generic\-\_\-package /play/jsp/jointfile.jsp}

Modified 9/27/15\-: rosrun playfile\-\_\-reader playfile\-\_\-cameraspace test\-\_\-cameraspace.\-csp This playfile version assumes desired gripper poses are expressed w/rt left camera optical frame; Uses tflistener to get transform from optical frame to each P\-S\-M base frame, then uses same I\-K code;

Looks encouraging. Gets out of reach for z $\sim$$>$= 0.\-16 (along optical axis) D\-O get significant gravity droop. Alignment looks good (red dot on gripper tips align w/ optical z axis) when gravity is reduced. (Should improve gains and reduce masses).

Can start up this way\-: {\ttfamily roslaunch dvrk\-\_\-model wsn\-\_\-davinci\-\_\-gazebo.\-launch} which starts 2 psm's along with stereo cameras, a table and a 1mm blue bar {\ttfamily rosrun davinci\-\_\-traj\-\_\-streamer davinci\-\_\-traj\-\_\-interpolator\-\_\-as} to get the trajectory interpolator running And from playfiles directory, retract grippers with\-: {\ttfamily rosrun playfile\-\_\-reader playfile\-\_\-cartspace retract.\-csp} then can run a camera-\/space playfile with, e.\-g.\-: {\ttfamily rosrun playfile\-\_\-reader playfile\-\_\-cameraspace test\-\_\-cameraspace.\-csp} which interprets a camera-\/space Cartesian file to drive the grippers.
